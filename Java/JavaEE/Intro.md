# Java EE

Java EE is a set of abstract specifications. Anybody is open to provide a working implementation for the specifications. The concrete implementations are contained in application servers.  

* Application servers like JBoss (and its community version - Wildfly), GlassFish, TomEE, Liberty, WebLogic, etc implement all Java EE specifications.  
* Some applications like Tomcat, Jetty, etc only implement the JSP/Serverless part of the Java EE API.
* Some libraries only implement part of the Java EE API like injection, JPA, etc
