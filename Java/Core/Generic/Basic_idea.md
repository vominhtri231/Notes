### Definition
- A class or interface with one or more type parameters is called generic class/interface or generic type.
- A method with one or more type parameters is called generic method.

### How it works
Java execute generic by 'erasure': the type is check in compile time and get erased in runtime.   
The purpose is to make new codes compatible with pre-generic codes.
