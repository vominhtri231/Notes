Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that focus on separating the cross-cutting concerns 
(E.G.: logging, detect changes, etc). It does so by adding addition behaviors to existing code without modifying the code itself (AKA: weaving).

It helps to provide modularity to OOP, not to replace OOP.

In Java, AOP can be done by AspectJ, SpringAOP, etc.
