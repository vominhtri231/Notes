Java EE is a set of abstract specifications.  
Application servers like JBoss (and its community version - Wildfly), GlassFish, TomEE, Liberty, WebLogic, etc implement all Java EE specifications.  
Some applications like Tomcat, Jetty, etc only implement the JSP/Serverlet part of the Java EE API. Some libraries only implement part of the Java EE API like injection, JPA, etc.
