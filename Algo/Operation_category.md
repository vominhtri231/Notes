# Operation category

## Binary operation

A operation on 2 elements of a set S to return a third element which also in S. (**closure**)

For example: Subtraction on real numbers, addition on integer numbers , union on sub sets of set A

## Group operation

A special binary operation, denoted as $\cdot$ , on set G, which should satisfy:

* **Closure**: already required for binary operation

* **Associativity**: The way we group doesn't change the result $ (a \cdot b)\cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) $

* **Identify element**: There is a unique element $e$ that does nothing when combine with any other element: $ a \cdot e = a $

* **Inverted element**: For every element $a$ has a unique corresponding element $a^{-1}$ that: $a \cdot a^{-1} = e$

For example:   Addition on integer numbers
